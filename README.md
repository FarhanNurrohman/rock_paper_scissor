# Rock-Paper-Scissors Hand Shape Classification Using TensorFlow
This project implements a supervised machine learning model to classify hand shapes for the game Rock-Paper-Scissors. Using Python and TensorFlow, the model is trained on image data to recognize and categorize hand gestures into one of three classes: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in image classification tasks.

## Key Features
* Data Preprocessing: Preparing hand shape images through resizing, normalization, and augmentation for enhanced model performance.
* Model Development: Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for hand gesture classification.
* Evaluation: Measuring model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix.
* Visualization: Displaying training progress, loss, accuracy, and predictions through visual tools.
## Tools and Technologies
* Python: For scripting and implementation.
* TensorFlow & Keras: For creating, training the deep learning model, image processing, and data augmentation.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing model performance and predictions.
## Dataset
The dataset contains labeled images of hand shapes representing Rock, Paper, and Scissors. It includes diverse variations in hand orientations, lighting conditions, and backgrounds to improve the model's generalization.

# Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy in classifying hand shapes, effectively distinguishing between Rock, Paper, and Scissors gestures. This can be extended for real-time applications, such as a computer-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

# Future Scope
Deploying the model in a real-time application using a webcam for gesture recognition.
Enhancing the dataset to include more variations in hand shapes and environmental conditions.
Exploring transfer learning to improve classification accuracy further.
